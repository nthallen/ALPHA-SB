Moduledef Nav {
  Module to collect all the navigation control code.
  This depends on the SpatialDual variable definitions,
  so it must appear after the SpatialDual module.
  The TM typedefs are also required by nav.sws, which means
  'Module Nav mode=types' must appear before the first
  swsbase definition.
